# GeoRust tester

This is an early experiment to interactively explore the GeoRust API. Inspirations include:

- [Cavalier Contours](https://cavaliercontours.dev)
- [iOverlay](https://ishape-rust.github.io/iShape-js/overlay/shapes_editor.html)

The goals are unclear, but one idea is to have one mode per [algorithm](https://docs.rs/geo/latest/geo/algorithm/index.html)
